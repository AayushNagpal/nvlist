enhancements:
- F5 can now be used as a hotkey to restart when debug mode is turned on.
- Replaced IDrawable.getColor with getColorRGB/getColorARGB to work better with
  Anim.* functions.
- Added an example usage of sprite tinting using IDrawable.setColor() to the
  image/basics tutorial.
- Moved Anim.* functions to a separate module (vn.anim)
- Added Anim.seq(), Anim.par() for sequential/parallel chaining of Animators.
- Added Anim.createWait() for adding pauses to chained Animators.
- Added Anim.waitFor() that blocks until the Animators passed as arguments
  have finished.
- Added loops parameter to Animator.start() to let the animation loop a specific
  number of times (or infinitely by using -1).
- Added example usage for Anim.* functions to the image/animations tutorial.
- Added vn.enableProofreaderTools preference that, when enabled, adds a report
  bug/typo button to the menu bar. This button automatically adds info about the
  current script location and merges bug reports into a single file.
- Changed the interfaces of the Camera object to be compatible with the new
  Anim.* functions. See camera tutorial for details.
- Added the ability to customize the text continue cursor image using the
  customTextBox function.
- Added a second parameter to TextDrawable.setCursor() to be able to turn off
  the automatic positioning. This makes a fixed position cursor possible.
- Added a textbox customization tutorial demonstrating setCustomTextBox
- Added vn.engineTargetVersion preference to allow you to specify which NVList
  version your VN was created for. This allows built-in functions to change
  their implementation but continue to function the same way for VNs targeting
  the old NVList version.
- Added an example image gallery script as a GUI tutorial.
    
bugfixes:
- JNG images were erroneously saved with premultiplied alpha by the optimizer.
- Fixed resource optimizer stripping start/end attributes from snd.xml



2012/05/25 -- 2.4 (r25)

enhancements:
- Made fog effect much more customizable.
- Added documentation to stdlib.lua and vn/gui.lua
- Added a changeVolume function to (gradually) change the volume of sound or
  music after they've started playing.
- Moved code related to the default titlescreen into its own file
  (titlescreen.lua), added a lot of code comments to it and main.lua
- Screenshot menu item now has the ability to save screenshots as JPEG
- Create new project button added to Build.jar, creating a new project now
  triggers an automatic rebuild. 
- Added Anim.* function for easily interpolating (animating) between two
  property values (for example color, or scale). Background animations also
  benefit; the new system saves a bit of typing.
    
bugfixes:
- Wipe tween ignored sprite transform (position, scale and rotation).
- Changes to the color or alpha of a name box would disappear after switching
  back and forth between ADV and NVL text modes
- Fixed a runtime exception when loading a 16-bit RGB image without alpha.
- Paragraphs longer than a few hundred characters could, under specific
  conditions, trigger a program crash on ATI graphics cards.
- Setting texture parameters on a GLSL object didn't force their
  initialization, making the textures appear transparent.
- Resource optimizer was broken, gave an error message when attempting to use.
- The return to title menu item accidentally reset the window size/position.
- Text (sub)lines consisting of only whitespace were eaten by the parser.



2012/05/01 -- 2.3 (r23)

enhancements:
- Implemented a basic auto-updater menu item (experimental, see game.ini)
  JVM running NVList must be closed before library files can be overwritten.
- Added a menu for setting the window size to a XX pct of the preferred size
- Camera.add() now returns an ICameraImage which can be used to change the
  image's depth after adding it to the Camera.

bugfixes:
- Generated installer splash screen was corrupted for images with alpha
- Launch4j PPC binaries (windres/ld) replaced with PPC/x64 universal binaries
  This should fix builds on Mac OS X Lion
- getPlayTime() function was broken.



2012/04/16 -- 2.2 (r21)

enchancements:
- Script errors printed on-screen now try to include a filename+line.
- Clicking to instantly display the entire paragraph now works properly for
  text with [bracketed] Lua code in it.
- When using the img/imgf functions with a sprite slot, the y parameter can
  now be used to change the baseline y. 
- The OSD (toggle with F7), now displays much more information.
- Added a quickload(slot) function
- text/appendText functions now support StyledText objects as their text args.
- waitForTextVisible function now takes an optional TextDrawable to wait for.
- The createStyledText function can now be called with a StyledText arg.
- Added a createLayer(name) function that calls imageState.createLayer()
- Image cache size can now be specified in pages. A page is the amount of
  memory required to store a full screen RGBA8 texture.
- Debug window got a line in the VRAM graph indicating the image cache limit.
- Added a vn.system module with lua wrappers for SystemLib functions.
- Added a website() function that opens a webpage in an external browser.
- Tuned the scale factor at which the main FBO starts mipmapping.
- The Lua tab in the debug window now contains a print stack trace button.
- Parse errors related to img.xml are now displayed on screen.
- Added BlurGS class that provides a scalable blur.
- Preferences starting with vn. can now be accessed through the prefs Lua table
- Implemented depth-of-field/perspective for the Camera object.
- Reduces mach banding of wipe tween (WipeGS).
- Changing the text layer constructor now triggers text layer recreation.
- quicksave/quickload now display a success message on screen.
- Added support for reading precomputed mipmaps from KTX files.
- Added prefs for readTextStyle, textLogStyle, choiceStyle, selectedChoiceStyle
- Added registerJavaClass() function for importing Java code from Lua.
- No longer requires separate executables for 32/64 bit Java.
- Building a release now creates a .exe version of the generated installer.
- Improved perceived startup time by showing an empty window early during init.
- Significantly improved image load times on slow singlecore processors.
- Reduced processor usage for sound playback, especially on slow singlecores.
- Game update stops when the window is minimized. 
- Video capture function (F8) now forces continuous repainting to reduce video
  stuttering.
- Added mouse wheel down as a text continue key.
- Changed Build.jar to automatically do a rebuild when necessary.
- Changed main.lua to act as a template for a standard VN titlescreen.

bugfixes:
- Rewrote the way OpenGL resources are managed internally. This should fix a
  memory leak occurring when the texture cache becomes full.
- Fixed mapping of linear volume dB gain. Previous implementation could raise
  output levels over their natural maximum.
- Text style property editor used by Build.jar now applies any pending edits
  when closing the popup dialog.
- Editing a preference in Build.jar now also updates save/prefs.ini
- Silently crashed if gluegen-rt was not in the library path.
- Keyconfig only read the first key specified for each line.
- Increased default minimum heap size to improve performance in situations
  with high garbage generation (like particle effects).
- When running on hardware incapable of NPOT textures that also doesn't support
  large textures, the just-in-time resize could cause a data alignment error. 
- ARGB screenshots were shifted up by 1 pixel in some instances.
- Improved support for escaped \$, \[ in text lines for syntax highlighters.
- Events enqueued with edt.addEvent() now wait while the main thread is blocked
- Saving could change the result of == for Lua userdata objects.
- Using alt+enter to return to windows mode from full screen advanced the text.
- Up key accidentally opened the text log even during a choice.
- Show text log menu item was broken.
- On some graphics cards, the menu bar popups were overlapped by the screen.
- Crash on UniChrome GPU for glReadPixels(type=GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8_REV)
- Drawing blended quads used wrong UV coords when NPOT textures unsupported.
- screen2image aspect ratio was wrong when FBOs turned off and the physical
  window didn't match the aspect ratio of the VN's virtual resolution.
- Setting the FBO preference to true, now really always forces the FBO on.
- Updated JOGL to 2012-02-28 build to fix compatibility with Mac OS X 10.5



2012/03/02 -- 2.1 (r15)

- Initial release
