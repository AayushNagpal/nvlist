      <p>The <code>android</code> global variable is set to <code>true</code> when running on the Android version of NVList.</p>
    </section>
    <section title="Text Rendering" level="2">
      <p>Text rendering between the desktop and Android versions of NVList are different on a fundamental level. Desktop NVList renders text to the screen one character at a time, while the Android version draws an entire paragraph to a texture and renders that. Also, the Android version renders text at the screen's native resolution for increased sharpness.</p>
      <p>In most cases it's better to disable custom textboxes when running on Android. The system resizes/positions the textbox on Android based on user preferences, so any custom textbox would need to handle this dynamic positioning (the built-in <code>customTextBox</code> function doesn't).</p>
    </section>
    <section title="GLSL" level="2">
      <p>The current version of NVList for Android uses GLES 1.0/1.1, which is roughly equivalent in capabilities to OpenGL 1.3 (which is rather old). Unfortunately GLES 1.x doesn't support hardware shaders (required by some special effects, notably the <code>BitmapTween</code>) even on graphics hardware which does have shaders.</p>

    <section title="Save Screen" level="2">
      <p>Android will default to using its own save/load screens.</p>

    <section title="Minor Issues" level="2">
      <ul>
        <li>Image/sound preloading doesn't currently work on Android (<code>preload</code> does nothing).</li>
        <li>JNG/KTX image formats are not supported.</li>
        <li>Theora video isn't supported on all devices (but you can use other video formats).</li>
        <li>Textures will use the system default format (usually <code>RGB565</code> or <code>RGBA8888</code>).</li>
